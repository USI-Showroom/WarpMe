Hardware accelerated image morphing with barycentric coordinates

## How do I get set up? ##

You need:

* C++ compiler
* Cmake
* Qt5

### Mac/linux

Use your favorite package manager (e.g., macports, yum, apt-get, etc...) to install the three dependencies. 
On Mac clang is better than g++ and can be installed for free with xcode

### Windows

* Install Visual Studio, the express or community version are free, to obtain the C++ compiler. 
* Download cmake from its official website (https://cmake.org/download/).
* Download Qt5.* from http://www.qt.io/download/ and install in C:\\. Carefull: install the 32bit version compatible with your C++ compiler.

## Compiling
Use cmake to generate make files (on unix), xcode project (on mac), or visual studio project (on windows).
